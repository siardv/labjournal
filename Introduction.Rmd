# Introduction

In his famous research Milgram (1967) found that on average there are most three connections separating two random Americans. More recently, Bakhshandeh et al. (2011) found that between two random Twitter users there is an average degree of separation of 3.43 connections. This means that between two randomly selected Twitter users, there are on average three or four Twitter users in between these randomly selected users. 

Such network analyses can not only be performed on Twitter data, but also in the context of science. Since 1996 the percentage of single-author papers has rapidly decreased. Where in 1996 50 percent of all published papers in economics journals were single-author papers, in 2021 just 2,1 percent of all papers were written by just one author (Choueiry, 2022; London School of Economics and Political Science, 2018). On the other hand, there has been a major rise in papers with three authors (London School of Economics and Political Science, 2018). 

With the rise of the amount of multi-author papers is also the rise of the internet. The ability of being able to connect to others around the world, and have access to others' papers more easily, makes for one reason for the increase of multi-author papers (source). In the literature, papers with more than one author are also referred to as co-authorship, or when used to refer to a network 'co-authorship networks' (SOURCE).

This increase of multi-author papers, and the online availability of information surrounding the authors, creates opportunities to look at collaborations from a different perspective. In this paper I will be trying to understand the relation between the preferences of researchers by taking a social network perspective. This perspective follows a different logic than 'mainstream' science, as in this perspective it is acknowledged that people do not 'stand alone', but are embedded in a network of people that (unconsciouly) influence the behaviour of the ego (SNASS book --> (Look at how to reference!!!)). 

** Still to add: Description of gender differences, introduction of concepts like homophily, research topics of researchers etc. **



This leads me to the following research question: 'What is the relative preference of men for men and women for women when collaborating for an academic research paper?'

A second research question that will be central to this paper is: 'What mechanisms can help explain the difference in preference of gender when looking for people to collaborate on an academic paper?'

# Research questions

Descriptive RQ: What is the relative preference of men for men and women for women?
Explanatory RQ: 'What mechanisms can help explain the difference in preference of gender when looking for people to work on an academic paper?' Moet nog iets verklaren. Preferentie verklaren waarom mannen voor mannen kiezen en vrouwen voor vrouwen
Paar mechanismen uitsluiten: homophily, productivity, research topics, seniority?
