# Introduction
Decades of research demonstrates persistent and troubling gender inequities across scientific fields (Fox 2005; Xie & Shauman 2003). While more women are earning PhDs and obtaining faculty positions, they continue to face marginalization and exclusion from scholarly networks critical for productivity and advancement (Misra et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2022). Women remain underrepresented as authors on published studies, often as "silent contributors" providing undisclosed labor (Mongeon et al. 2017). These ongoing gender gaps likely stem, in part, from homophily bias shaping collaboration patterns in ways that disadvantage women (McPherson et al. 2001).

Homophily, the tendency to associate with similar others, powerfully segregates social networks along salient lines of difference like gender (McPherson et al. 2001). Same-gender preferences likely arise due to psychological affinity but also structural barriers that increase the costs of crossing group boundaries (Ruef et al. 2003). Gender homophily in research collaborations may be further amplified by skewed settings with few women faculty, as posited by Kanter’s (1977) theory of token minorities facing heightened boundary policing.

This study quantitatively examines how the gender composition of academic departments impacts gender homophily in faculty research collaborations. It tests the hypothesis that environments with more imbalanced gender ratios exhibit greater gender homophily in co-authorship networks. The objective is to model the extent of gender homophily and assess how it varies based on the demographic makeup of departments.

Dynamic social network modeling enables analyzing the evolution of faculty co-authorship networks over time (Snijders et al. 2010). This technique estimates the changing tendencies for authors to select collaborators based on gender and other factors, while accounting for existing network structures that also shape tie formation (Ripley et al. 2022). The rsiena package in R is utilized, which facilitates modeling the interdependent, longitudinal network dynamics (Ripley et al. 2022).

This research applies a social networks perspective to the sociology of science (Granovetter 1973). It recognizes scholars are embedded within collaborative structures impacting their productivity and advancement (Fox 2005). Theoretically, it accounts for how an author’s connections shape their output and status. Methodologically, it models the non-independence of co-authorship ties rather than treating observations as atomized - a key tenet of social network analysis (Wasserman & Faust 1994).
