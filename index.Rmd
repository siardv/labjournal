# My Lab Journal
Last compiled on `r format(Sys.time(), '%B, %Y')`


- Week 1 
  - Formulated research question on how gender composition of academic departments relates to gender homophily in research collaborations
  - Conducted literature review on homophily, gender inequality in academia, social networks
  - Identified relevant theories such as tokenism that may explain greater gender divides in skewed settings

- Week 2
  - Collected data on faculty names, gender, titles, and contact info by webscraping department website  
  - Queried Crossref API to retrieve metadata on faculty publications
  - Parsed HTML table into dataframe and cleaned column names
  - Standardized faculty names and predicted gender using R packages
  - Difficulty handling API query errors for some author names
  
- Week 3
  - Filtered publications data to only journal articles
  - Completed partial dates and formatted into standard structure
  - Combined multiple affiliation columns into single column
  - Removed missing data rows and columns
  - Manipulated data into analysis format with author name, gender, affiliations etc. 
  - Challenges unnesting inconsistent author column lists
  
- Week 4
    - Generated node and edge data frames for the co-authorship network
    - Calculated basic network metrics with igraph to explore topology
    - Visualized network statically using igraph's plot function
    - Started dynamic network modeling with RSiena but faced specification issues
    - Goal is to model network evolution incorporating structural effects and attributes
  
- Week 5 
    - Refined RSiena model specifications based on previous diagnostics
    - Included key structural effects and covariates like gender and rank
    - Ran models across time periods until reaching convergence 
    - Assessed model fit using goodness-of-fit diagnostics, resulted in error: need to fix
    - Will need to evaluate additional fit statistics before finalizing 
    - Began drafting results section but too early to share due to current model issues
    - Next steps are finalizing model specification, assessing effects, and interpreting implications
