# Theory


Assumptions

- There are more male researchers than there are women researchers

- People prefer to work with people that have the same gender as them

- As there are more potential male collaborators, the likelihood of contacting a male researcher is higher

- Homophily effect


H1a: Men are more likely to collaborate with men
H1b: Women are more likely to collaborate with women
H1c: Men are more likely to collaborate with men than women are likely to collaborate with women


H2: The transitivity effect is stronger for men than for women


Assumptions
 
 - Men are more preferred when starting in academics
 
 - Therefore men have a higher likelihood of being preferred for a paper
 
 - With more published papers, women gain more 'respect' and popularity compared to men 
 
 - Effect of more published papers is therefore bigger for women than for men

H3: The effect of the amount of published papers is stronger for women than for men
