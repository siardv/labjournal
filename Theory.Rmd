# Theory

This research is grounded in social network theory, which provides a powerful lens for analyzing the relational architecture underpinning collaboration in academia.
In particular, we draw on key concepts from Granovetter's seminal work on the strength of weak ties (Granovetter, 1973) and Burt's structural holes theory (Burt, 1992).

Granovetter demonstrated that weak interpersonal ties often serve as indispensable bridges between densely knit social clusters, enabling novel ideas and opportunities to diffuse across the network.
This highlights the importance of analyzing patterns of connectivity and closure.
Structural holes theory further explicates how strategically bridging disconnected groups in a network yields competitive advantages in access to information and control over flows.

Together, these foundational network theories underscore how the specific structure and topology of scholarly collaboration networks can profoundly shape diffusion of knowledge and inequality of access.
This provides the impetus for our granular network analysis.

We also situate our research within the extensive literature on gender disparities in academia.
Prior studies have documented lower research output, weaker international visibility, and lower citations rates for female scholars, even after controlling for academic rank, discipline and other factors (Larivi√®re et al., 2013; Dion et al., 2018).

These disadvantages accumulate over careers and are mirrored in striking underrepresentation of women in senior positions.
Extensive research points to subtle but pervasive gender biases permeating peer review, hiring, promotion, remuneration, and service burdens as contributing factors (Reuben et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2016).

However, less attention has focused directly on elucidating gender effects embedded within the intricate relational networks underpinning scholarly collaboration.
This echoes Granovetter's (1985) assertion that economic action is inherently "embedded in ongoing networks of personal relationships".

Charting gender asymmetries in the relational architecture shaping knowledge creation is therefore pivotal.
Our application of social network analysis to map collaborative ties enables empirically tracking how gender may permeate this core academic process.

Integrating these perspectives, we posit the structure of faculty co-authorship networks may be shaped by gender effects, with significant implications. We propose and test six hypotheses.

## Hypotheses

- $H_1$: Female researchers will demonstrate lower triadic closure in their co-authorship ties compared to male researchers.

- $H_2$:Female scholars will have lower betweenness centrality compared to male counterparts.

- $H_3$:Ego-network density will be lower for female versus male researchers.

- $H_4$:Average path length and diameter will be greater in the networks of female researchers.

- $H_5$:Female scholars will have a lower clustering coefficient than male scholars.

- $H_6$:Controlling for academic rank, gender differences across $H_1$-$H_5$ will persist.

Support for these hypotheses would suggest female scholars may contend with more fragmented, less navigable collaboration networks.
This could hinder innovation and advancement.

Conversely, null results would imply the topological structure of co-authorship ties is not influenced by gender.
By empirically testing for gender effects across critical network dimensions, this research elucidates hidden relational dynamics shaping academia.

Uncovering obfuscated collaborative barriers is essential for constructing more equitable pathways to scientific innovation.
This study's integration of social network and gender theories provides a robust framework to investigate gender disparities within the relational architecture enabling scholarship.
