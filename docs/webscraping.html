<li>Queried Crossref API using <code>rcrossref</code> package to
retrieve metadata for publications by each faculty member
<ul>
<li>Passed faculty names as search queries</li>
<li>Retrieved full bibliographic data including titles, journals, dates,

<li>Standardized faculty names by removing non-word characters</li>
<li>Used the <code>gender</code> R package with 5 different prediction
methods (ssa, ipums, napp, kantrowitz, genderize) to predict gender from
first names, keeping most confident result</li>
<li>Joined predicted gender back to faculty data frame</li>
<li>Unnested article authors into separate rows for each faculty
author</li>
