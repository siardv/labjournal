# To-Do List

## Introduction
- Provide more specifics on the faculty being analyzed (size, departments, research areas, etc.)
- Note 1-2 limitations of prior university-wide network studies that this faculty-level analysis aims to address  
- Add extra recent references to further demonstrate familiarity with latest literature

## Theory
- Briefly mention the statistical network models that will be used to test the hypotheses (e.g. ERGMs, SAOMs)
- Expand a bit more on Burt's structural holes theory and its relevance to the hypothesis about gender differences in betweenness centrality
- Tie Hypothesis 3 about ego-network density more explicitly back to the theory of strength of weak ties 
- Add recent referencea specifically related to gender differences in academic networks or collaboration 
- Consider any additional gender-related academic collaboration factors relevant to the theory

## Analysis
### Descriptives
- Briefly mention the timeframe/duration of the network data (e.g. co-authorships over the past 5 years).
- Provide 1-2 example network visualizations to accompany the descriptive statistics (e.g. sociogram, degree distribution plot).
- Report the assortativity coefficient to quantify homophily by gender.
- Consider presenting the statistics in a table for conciseness
- Indicate the network analytics software/code used to calculate the metrics. 

### Data Preparation
- Construct adjacency matrices representing the observed networks at each timepoint
    - Necessary to represent the network data for analysis in RSiena
- Integrate node attribute data (gender, rank, department, etc.)
    - Enables testing effects of researcher characteristics on collaboration patterns
- Address any missing data through imputation or other methods
    - Reduces potential biases and improves accuracy of network metrics

### Preliminary Analysis
- Explore degree distributions and summary stats at each timepoint
    - Provides insights into the overall network topology
- Visualize network evolution over time using animations or plots
    - Reveals patterns and guides model specification
- Examine differences by gender, rank, and department using t-tests, ANOVA, etc.
    - Quantifies differences along dimensions like gender and rank

### RSiena Model Specification
- Select effects based on research questions and theory
    - Chosen effects should test hypothesized mechanisms 
- Specify structural effects like reciprocity, transitivity/closure
    - Tests how network configurations emerge
- Add attribute-based effects like gender homophily and preferential attachment
    - Assesses how researcher characteristics shape collaboration 
- Introduce controls like density, connectivity, indegree popularity
    - Accounts for overall connectivity patterns

### RSiena Estimation
- Select algorithm parameters and optimization procedure
    - Ensures accurate parameter estimates
- Assess convergence and t-ratios to refine model
    - Improves model reliability
- Check robustness across different random seeds
    - Reduces dependence on initial values
- Examine output to interpret parameters and effects
    - Enables drawing valid conclusions

### Model Diagnostics
- Conduct goodness-of-fit analysis on multiple metrics
    - Evaluates model fit to observed network patterns
- Compare simulated vs observed degree distributions
    - Checks similarity between simulated and empirical data
- Check triad census distribution
    - Assesses parameter estimation quality

### Model Expansion
- Build multilayer multiplex models to add richer data
    - Incorporates interdependencies between networks
- Incorporate additional covariates and interactions
    - Tests new explanations and hypotheses
- Test alternative specifications and constraints
    - Improves model insights
- Examine heterogeneity across departments
    - Explores department variation

## Sensitivity Analysis
- Vary time window durations between waves
    - Evaluates temporal model assumptions
- Remove potential outlier nodes or periods
    - Assesses impacts of outliers
- Test model robustness to perturbations
    - Checks stability and reproducibility

# Justification

Each step aims to rigorously test hypothesized effects, ensure valid and reliable conclusions, and maximize model insights. The tasks build a comprehensive analysis that moves from descriptive exploration to explaining network evolution through stochastic actor-oriented modeling. Let me know if any justifications need more explanation!
